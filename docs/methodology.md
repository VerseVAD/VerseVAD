## What VerseVAD measures

VerseVAD will describe the distribution of text tokens and phrases that match
entries in selected affective lexicons. Depending on the resource, an entry may
carry normative valence, arousal, and dominance ratings; categorical emotion or
sentiment associations; or emotion-intensity ratings.

These measurements describe lexical associations under a documented matching
policy. They do not establish the emotion of a poem, the state of a speaker,
the experience of a reader, or an author's intention.

## Units that must remain distinct

- The preserved original is the text supplied by the scholar.
- A text version is one immutable state of that original.
- A token occurrence has a position, structure, context, and surface form.
- A normalized form is a separate processing representation.
- A lemma is a model-assisted base form conditioned on part of speech.
- A lexicon entry is an independently sourced word or phrase with source data.
- A match links an occurrence or span to an entry and records how it matched.
- An aggregate summarizes included matches for a declared analysis scenario.
- Literary interpretation remains a scholarly act outside the numeric score.

## Provisional default recipe

The default recipe for implementation and testing is:

1. preserve the original text and its line and stanza boundaries;
2. create a Unicode-normalized processing representation without overwriting
   the original;
3. retain capitalization but perform case-insensitive lexicon lookup;
4. exclude punctuation from numeric summaries while keeping it in the audit;
5. attempt exact normalized surface-form matches first;
6. apply conservative apostrophe and possessive normalization;
7. prefer the longest exact phrase when the selected adapter supports phrases;
8. use POS-sensitive lemma fallback only after exact candidates fail;
9. use reviewed mappings only when their scope and approval allow it;
10. do not stem, guess historical substitutions, or infer coined-word meanings;
11. do not automatically invert scores near negation;
12. include matched stopwords in the primary scenario;
13. report token- and type-weighted summaries separately;
14. show matched counts and coverage with every aggregate;
15. preserve all candidate, suppression, exclusion, and match provenance.

This recipe will be versioned. Changes create new analyses rather than altering
completed results.

## VAD summaries

Token-weighted summaries count every included occurrence. Type-weighted
summaries count each unique matched lexicon entry once within the declared unit.
Unmatched tokens are absent from the numeric mean; they are not assigned 0,
0.5, or another neutral value.

Cross-scale comparison may use a separate normalized score when the adapter's
source scale supports a documented linear transformation. Original scores and
source limits always remain available.

## Emotion association summaries

NRC Emotion Lexicon values are binary associations, not intensities. A term may
belong to multiple categories, so category percentages need not total 100%.
Every percentage will state its denominator.

## Emotion intensity summaries

Prevalence and intensity answer different questions and remain separate:

- prevalence describes how often matched emotion-associated vocabulary occurs;
- mean intensity summarizes source intensities only among entries matched for
  that emotion.

A token without a score for an emotion is not an intensity-zero observation in
the primary mean.

## Context and close reading

Negation, irony, metaphor, quotation, speaker attribution, narrative distance,
and historical sense are not solved by lexicon matching. VerseVAD may flag
contexts for review, but flags will not silently change primary scores.
Scholar-approved exclusions or mappings will create explicit alternative
scenarios with visible before-and-after results.

## Sparse and uncertain results

Aggregates with few matched items will be marked sparse or unstable. Missing
data remains missing rather than becoming zero. Coverage, lemma reliance,
mapping reliance, exclusions, and semantic-risk dependence are part of the
result, not merely diagnostics hidden elsewhere.
